Part of being a web developer is having to work with multiple languages and multiple technologies.  We are in the process of moving all our front-end javascript to [backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org), and I thought it would be a good idea to have a refresher on javascript and jQuery to get the team in the right mindset during this transition.

Our first presentation has been put on our public [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/zumbatech) account: [Javascript: the Important Bits](http://www.slideshare.net/zumbatech/javascript-the-importantbits).

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

In the near future, we're also doing something similar for PHP, including new 5.4 features, namespaces with autoload, and other similar topics.
