Let me start out by saying that before I started working here at Zumba Fitness, my perception of companies that were not “tech companies” was completely wrong. I was very naive, and thought that those companies did not have the correct culture to nurture and expand my career as a software engineer. Sure, not all companies will be the same, but at least there are some companies such as Zumba® that strongly believe in technology.
Our team is constantly innovating and we are on top of the latest technology. Don’t believe me? Here is some inside knowledge about our Zumba® Technology Day.

Nowadays, a lot of the big tech companies have some sort of program that incentivizes it’s employees to tinker with ideas that are not part of their assigned work. Apparently this concept was [started by 3m](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1663137/how-3m-gave-everyone-days-off-and-created-an-innovation-dynamo) and then was made famous by Google with their  “20 percent program” in which employees get 20% of their time to work on side projects or ideas.
Following their footsteps, we decided to implement in-house a similar program called “Zumba® Technology Day”, where the technology department gets at least one day a month, usually the last Thursday of the month. To actually experiment and come up with new ideas that can benefit the company.

The way our tech day works it’s pretty simple.
We have a google doc that we use as master list of ideas that anyone at anytime can go in and update.
<i>Note that the document is only as a place for inspiration and to keep ideas. We do not force anyone to go by this document</i>. In fact, we only have 2 actual rules:

* The only interrupts that will be taken are business critical interrupts.
* The Technology team must work on something that stabilizes our current systems or designs for the future. This includes documenting what we now have, designing a future vision, prototyping something that will help solve a business problem, documenting an improvement to the development process, automating tests, writing scripts, bashing a bunch of pet peeve bugs, researching an alternative technology,  or the like.

It’s been well over a year since we established this Day in our department and it has already proven to be a success. Not only some of the ideas/projects that started in a tech day became actual projects that are now vital part of our company, but it has also allowed us to have a day where we can interact with each other in a different setting. A setting that we can work without the pressure of a deadline and restrictions from business. It’s our time to be creative!
