Zumba Fitness<sup>&reg;</sup>'s techology department will begin blogging about the technology that we use,
the problems that we encounter, and the cool things that's in development.

We'll also use this as a platform to announce projects that our team has decided to
open-source.  We look forward to feedback (and hopefully some pull-requests) from
the community.
