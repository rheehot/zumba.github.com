The last weekend Stephen and I went to the <a href="http://cakefest.org" rel="external">CakeFest 2013</a>, in San Francisco/US.
CakeFest is the annual conference from the CakePHP group and has workshop sessions to show how to do
application from basic to advanced. Also, couple talks on the conference portion.

Either Stephen and I made a talk on the conference portion. He talked about
<a href="http://requirejs.org/" rel="external">Require.js</a>
and I talked about some tools/services for monitoring applications and servers.
I also talked about <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/" rel="external">AWS OpsWorks</a>.
The feedback was very good. People came to talk with us after the talks or in the happy hours and it
was very rewarding.

I went to the CakeFest 2012, in Manchester/UK, and I can say this year was better. All the talks were on the same room,
making everybody watch all the presentations instead of switch rooms. Having everybody in the same room also made the
people to talk with others and making nicer happy hours. This year some sessions were more interactive too, such as
people contributing to the CakePHP projects.

If you want to see the topics and the slides, you can check on <a href="lanyrd.com/2013/cakefest/" rel="external">Lanyrd</a>.
Stephen's and mine presentations are there!
