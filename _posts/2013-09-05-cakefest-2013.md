The last weekend Stephen and I went to <a href="http://cakefest.org" rel="external">CakeFest 2013</a> in San Francisco, US.
CakeFest is the annual conference from the CakePHP group and has workshop sessions to show how to do
application from basic to advanced as well as both long and short talks.

Stephen and I gave talks at the conference. Stephen gave a talk on
<a href="http://requirejs.org/" rel="external">Require.js</a> in CakePHP applications
and I gave a talk on some tools and services for monitoring applications and servers.
I also gave a talk on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/" rel="external">AWS OpsWorks</a>.
The feedback was very good. People came to talk with us after the talks or in the happy hours and it
was very rewarding.

I went to the CakeFest 2012, in Manchester/UK, and I can say this year was better. All the talks were in the same room,
making everybody watch all the presentations instead of switch rooms. Having everybody in the same room also increased collaboration
and made for nicer happy hours. Some sessions were more interactive too, such as
people contributing to the CakePHP projects.

If you want to see the topics and the slides, you can check on <a href="lanyrd.com/2013/cakefest/" rel="external">Lanyrd</a>.
Both our presentations are there!
