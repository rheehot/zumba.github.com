			The technology stack at Zumba Fitness<sup>&reg;</sup>, like many companies' stacks, runs on open source technology.  We gain
			many benefits by utilizing the community's efforts in making safe, reliable, and free open-source
			software.
		</p>
		<p>
			We've decided that we want to give back to the community.

		<h2>Open Source</h2>
		<p>
			Zumba Fitness<sup>&reg;</sup> is proud to start the process of open sourcing some of the tools that our technology

		<h2>Blog</h2>
		<p>
			Sometimes concepts are just as important as code.  As our team develops and maintains
			our international and high-traffic website, we encounter problems that our team has to solve.
			The goal of this blog is to share some of that experience with others, and hopefully have some of you
			share some experience with us.
