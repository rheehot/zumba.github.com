## Zumba Public Engineering Site

This repo contains a [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) templated site made
to deploy on Github's Pages.

### Run Locally

To compile the template into html, you will need to install the Jekyll gem:

```shell
sudo gem install jekyll
```

To run the server (default port 4000), clone the repo and run from the root directory:

```shell
jekyll --server
```

If you want to just compile the code (into the `_site` directory):

```shell
jekyll --no-server
```
